# OpenSLP bindings for nodejs

[OpenSLP](http://www.openslp.org/) is an open source Service Location Protocol (SLP) implementation. You can think of SLP as a Zeroconf/Bonjour protocol.

## Installation

    npm install slp

## API

This module follows the original [OpenSLP API](http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/ProgrammersGuide/index.html) quite closely.

## Usage

Register a service

```js
var slp = require('slp');

slp.reg('service:myservice://192.168.10.1:80', slp.MAX_LIFETIME, '', function (err) {
  if (!err)
    console.log('service registered!');
});
```
